<!-- ## **Boyu Guan (管博宇)** -->

I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at the **Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences**, and a member of the **State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems**, where I am advised by [**Prof. Chengqing Zong (宗成庆)**](https://nlpr.ia.ac.cn/cip/cqzong.htm) and [**Assoc. Prof. Yang Zhao (赵阳)**](https://yzhaoiacas.netlify.app/).


My research lies at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**, with a current focus on **Video-Guided Machine Translation (VMT)**. In this line of work, I explore how visual and linguistic signals can be effectively fused to enhance translation performance and efficiency.

Looking ahead, I am particularly interested in expanding my research to **video question answering** and broader topics in **multimodal understanding**.

You can find my CV here: [**Boyu Guan's Curriculum Vitae**](../../files/CV_BoyuGuan.pdf).
If you're interested in collaboration or would like to chat, feel free to reach out to me at *guanboyu2022[at]ia.ac.cn*.
